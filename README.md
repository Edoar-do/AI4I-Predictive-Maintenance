# AI4I-Predictive-Maintenance
End-to-end Machine Learning project about Predictive Maintenance.
Given a data-set of industrial data, the first step is data analysis and preprocessing. The next step is searching for efficient models with good performances on training and, mostly, testing data.
A special focus lies on finding models as comprehensible as possible for humans.

# The task
The task of this problem is to classify machine failures so that, with given industrial feature values, engineers can be supported in decision making.
